					<h2> Social Networking </h2> <!-- Intro + BBS -->
					<p> Social Networking is a large part of today's society. The use of the internet helps others connect to anyone around the world at any time. <br> <br> <br>
					The basis of social networking is inspired by the use of the Bulletin Board System (BBS). The BBS was developed by Ward Christensen in 1978 and allows users to create an account and share content of all kinds. The very first BBSes could only be connected via a dial-up modem and a phone line and were extremely slow. As modem speeds increased so did the popularity of BBSes. By 1996 the BBS was at its most popular state, just as the World Wide Web was gaining popularity. A few years later the use of BBSes faded as the WWW took over. People today still refer online message boards and forums as BBSes.</p>

					<p> 2004 saw the beginning of a social network empire. Facesmash was created by Harvard Student Mark Zuckerburg and a few of his college mates. The original idea was to compare two people using a hot or not principle using the profile pictures of the facebooks of Harvard. After getting expelled for hacking into the Harvard system Zuckerburg continued to create The Facebook. It began as an exclusive website for only Harvard students, and then other schools were allowed access. By 2005 The Facebook was going really well, students from schools all around the United States has facebook accounts. The same year the “the” was dropped from the name. </p>
